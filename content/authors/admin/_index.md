I am an early career researcher focusing on the study of large-scale patterns of biodiversity, and
the ecological and evolutionary processes that shaped them. Throughout my career, I have gained extensive experience in the field of data science including data processing and
visualisation, advanced statistical and spatial analysis. In my work, I particularly enjoy exploring and
analysing biological data through visualisations tools.
